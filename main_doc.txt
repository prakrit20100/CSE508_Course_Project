[1] The information about the Hamiltons originated with Stone, who relayed it to Colonial Williamsburg when he offered the portrait there in 1941 (photocopy of letter from Stone to James L. Cogar, curator, Colonial Williamsburg, 13 March 1941, in NGA curatorial files; courtesy of Richard Miller, associate curator, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center, Williamsburg, Virginia).  Stone apparently did not pass the information along to the Garbisches when they purchased the painting.  General Schuyler Hamilton's grandfather was Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804), George Washington's secretary of the treasury from 1789-1795, while Griffin was serving in Congress., classification: Painting, subclassification: nan, iiifthumburl: https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7d7c08a8-e852-46b8-a027-ef73ea01f416/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg, assistivetext: nan, Difficulty: 8.0

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41)., classification: Print, subclassification: nan, iiifthumburl: https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5628af0d-818f-45bf-9f7e-924ba29851ee/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg, assistivetext: nan, Difficulty: 8.0

[1] The triple portrait and Sully's pendant portraits of the children's parents were offered for sale by John Foster Jenkins, Jr., who advertised them in a brochure entitled "Three Portraits by Thomas Sully."  The Cleveland Museum of Art purchased the pendant portraits directly from him in 1916, but this part of the provenance of the National Gallery's painting is unclear.  Albert Rosenthal, in a letter to Chester Dale's secretary (10 December 1935, in NGA curatorial files), says that he purchased the painting from descendants of the David family through James B. Townshend, publisher of _American Art News_.  The painting was reproduced in that magazine (16 June 1917: 5) with the caption "Recently sold to Mr. Albert Rosenthal of Phila.," and Dale collection notes in NGA curatorial files indicate the purchase was probably in May 1917. Cornelius Michaelsen wrote to Mr. Dale's secretary that he had purchased the painting from Mr. Rosenthal's private collection (letter of 15 September 1935 in NGA curatorial files).  However, other notes in the NGA curatorial files indicate the painting was purchased by Rosenthal jointly with Ehrich Galleries.  A 1918 publication by Ehrich Galleries (_One Hundred Early American Paintings_) lists paintings that have "at various times been in our possession," and the absence of a private owner's name in the listing for the Sully implies ownership by them.  In the 1935 letter Rosenthal does not recall having lent it to any public exhibition, but it was in a 1931 exhibition at the New Jersey State Museum that he organized, and listed as lent by Ferergil Galleries, who were, with Ehrich Galleries, the main lenders., classification: Painting, subclassification: nan, iiifthumburl: https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8ff2d6a0-c863-4127-bb9a-7edd6a56650a/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg, assistivetext: nan, Difficulty: 8.0

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.
